    <h1>Join the Lab</h1>

    <h2>Information for Prospective Lab Members</h2>

    <p>
      If you are interested in joining the lab, this document will help you understand what we look for in prospective lab members. Please read it carefully before contacting Dr. Zeng about potential research opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Are Looking For</h3>

    <p>
      In addition to strong motivation and curiosity about promoting health and equity, our research involves diverse skills across behavioral science, data analysis, and community engagement. The specific needs vary by project, but successful lab members typically demonstrate several of the following qualities and abilities, along with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn new ones:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="subtitle">Working with data and scientific reasoning</span><br>
        Much of our work involves analyzing health-related data. Lab members should be able to think critically about how data can answer research questions related to physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and well-being. Experience with software such as R, RStudio, and familiarity with statistical modeling, data visualization, or mixed methods research, are highly valued.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="subtitle">Research design and community-based implementation</span><br>
        Many of our projects take place in schools, Head Start programs, and community centers. We value members who can contribute to study design, recruitment, data collection, and intervention delivery in real-world settings. Experience with survey design, accelerometer data, behavioral observations, or intervention studies is advantageous, as is an understanding of community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="subtitle">Reproducible and ethical research workflows</span><br>
        Reproducibility and transparency are cornerstones of rigorous science. Lab members are expected to document their work carefully, manage data responsibly, and contribute to shared research materials (e.g., codebooks, data dictionaries, reports).
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="subtitle">Communication and organization</span><br>
        Strong writing, presentation, and interpersonal communication skills are essential. Whether preparing reports, drafting manuscripts, or presenting findings to community partners, lab members should be proactive, organized, and clear in their communication. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their work — setting goals, preparing meeting agendas, taking notes, and following up regularly with Dr. Zeng and collaborators.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="subtitle">Collaboration and generosity</span><br>
        Science and community work thrive on teamwork. We value individuals who are kind, generous, and committed to building a supportive and inclusive environment. Members of the lab are expected to uplift others, share credit generously, and approach collaboration with humility and respect. We especially appreciate applicants who have demonstrated leadership in teamwork, mentoring, or service.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Values We Share</h3>

    <p>
      Even if you do not currently have all of the skills above, you are still encouraged to reach out. What matters most is a genuine commitment to learning, an interest in health promotion research, and a willingness to grow. You can strengthen your preparation through coursework, research assistantships, or independent learning before joining the lab.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Active Living Lab (ALL) is firmly committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion in research, teaching, and community engagement. We strive to create a welcoming, supportive, and intellectually vibrant environment that values the full diversity of human experiences — including race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, socioeconomic background, national origin, sexual orientation, ability, and religion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above all, we expect all members — including Dr. Zeng — to actively foster a respectful, collaborative, and safe lab culture built on trust, openness, and shared purpose.
    </p>
